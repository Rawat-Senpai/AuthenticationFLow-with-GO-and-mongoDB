This backend code provides a full authentication flow for a Go-based web application. When run locally using the Go command, users can register, log in, and reset their passwords. If a user forgets their password, they can request a one-time password (OTP) sent to their email via Gmail. Upon successful authentication, users receive a JSON Web Token (JWT), which they can use for verification and accessing their text data, typically for an online notes application.
